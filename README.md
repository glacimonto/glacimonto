# Glacimonto

Glacimonto is an opinionated test framework.

It was inspired by the practice of Acceptance-Test Driven Development (and Specification by Example) and created to fill the gap between functional requirements and their hidden tests _glue code_.

Glacimonto name was inspired by Seb Rose, who's idea was to revised the test pyramid metaphor according to test readability and readers ability :
[The Testing Iceberg](http://claysnow.co.uk/the-testing-iceberg/)

We envisioned a tool allowing multiple levels of readability, providing a single place for our beloved _three amigos_ (business analysts or domain experts, testers and developers) to co-create, share and execute their acceptance tests, forming a real living documentation.

And since we are a bunch of staunch polyglots, we picked the name from Esperanto.
And thus,

Glacimonto was born.
